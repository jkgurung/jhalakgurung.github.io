              I wanted to create a physical button that my dog could hit with his paw or nose to send me a text message when he needs to go outside to the bathroom. I decided to use a Raspberry Pi (a small, cheap Linux computer), a momentary switch (a physical push button), and Node to program the text messaging logic when the button is pressed.

              It works! You press the button and it sends me a text message from my dog saying "I need to go to the bathroom!". It would be cool to additionally 3D print a case and button surface area extending disc, but the functional pieces are here.

              You could probably use cheaper items instead, but I chose these items to simplify the setup (skip installing Linux, soldering, and wiring up circuits and so I could use Node and npm in a Linux environment which I am comfortable with).

            <Paragraph>
              Once NOOBS has installed the operating system (this will take a few minutes), a reboot will occur and Raspbian should start by default going forward. Raspbian is the official operating system for Raspberry Pis and is a fork of Debian (a Linux distribution). It has all the basics you would expect from a Linux computer (browser, terminal, file system).

              You will need a code editor. I use Vim which can be installed with (<Code>sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install vim</Code>); there are other terminal-based editors or some editors inside the Raspbian menu you can use as well. Next you will need to create your project code; you can view mine in the <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/dog-bathroom-button'>dog-bathroom-button</Anchor> repo. This uses a few dependencies which can be installed with <Code>npm install</Code>. Then, running <Code>npm start</Code> will start the Node process which listens for the button press (on the GPIO 3 pin) and sends a text message using Twilio. It also has a debounce wrapper so that the button can only fire a text message once every 10 seconds, even if it is pressed more than once in that time period (for the over-eager dog).

              You can have the script run automatically on boot by adding <Code>{`cd {project} && npm start &`}</Code> to the <Code>/etc/rc.local</Code> file. This file is run when Raspian boots, and adding the <Code>&</Code> to the end runs the server as a background process. Once this is done, you can shutdown the device, unplug everything, and then re-plug in only the power adapter and the program will run on its own by any outlet in your home.

              I set up a phone contact for my dog with his picture to make the texts more clear. I also set up "Emergency Bypass" for the contact (a feature on iOS that lets the contact through even if your phone is on silent) to ensure I always hear when my dog needs to go out.

              When working on a Raspberry Pi, it should always be shut down safely before power is removed to avoid corrupting the SD card. The easiest way to do this is tapping "Shutdown" from the "Menu" button. When you want to use it again, just plug the power adapter in and it will take you to the Raspbian desktop again by default.

              This project was a lot of fun. Although I'm not sure how practical it will be - if my dog can even use it - it was a great learning experience. Embedded systems are powerful and with modern technology can be controlled with languages like Node that are more traditionally seen in use on the web. Go forth and play with hardware!
