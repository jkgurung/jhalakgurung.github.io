              I have always wanted to create a custom color scheme. Last year I finally took the plunge with help from <Anchor href='https://twitter.com/AC_Design'>Adam Christiansen</Anchor> as the designer, and <Anchor href='http://merrickchristensen.com/'>Merrick Christensen</Anchor> as a fellow developer. We built <Anchor href='/projects/nova'>Nova - A color scheme for modern web development</Anchor>.

            <Paragraph>
              We had a set of goals for the project

            <Paragraph>
              We especially wanted each color to have a dedicated meaning so that the color scheme was functional

            <Paragraph>
              We wanted the project to be easy to maintain, so we decided to create a source module called <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/nova-colors'>nova-colors</Anchor> that could contain all of the color values (organized by color meaning), and then use this module in the repo for each editor and tool so that they could all be updated from the same source. We did this for editors (Vim, Atom), terminal emulators (Hyper, iTerm), and other tools (Git, tmux). Here is an example of <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/nova-vim/blob/master/src/index.js'>the Nova Vim plugin</Anchor>; you can see how the <Code>src/</Code> directory contains the vim-specific wire-up while using the <Code>nova-colors</Code> package for color values, and then this gets compiled.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              The nice thing about having <Code>nova-colors</Code> as its own package is it can be used anywhere; for example, <Anchor href='https://github.com/trevordmiller/trevordmiller-website/blob/master/utils/styleGuide/index.js#L1-L10'>I'm using it on my own website as part of the style guide module</Anchor>.

              I would recommend using a shared location for source values for things like style guides and color schemes, with a compile step - it makes using and maintaining them a lot easier ;)
