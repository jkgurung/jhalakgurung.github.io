    description: `I'm working on building a proof of concept for rendering the same set of React components across targets (web, native mobile, native desktop, and email). This is primarily a learning experience for me and a proof of concept, rather than a real application to be used by others; I want to see if I can use a single set of GraphQL connected React components across multiple platforms. This project has a GraphQL API using Node connected to dummy data, an npm component library using Apollo to connect component data to the API, and a set of clients that consume the component library with some wrapping platform-specific code; the clients include web (using React DOM with Next.js), native mobile (using React Native with Expo), and native desktop (using Electron with Next.js).`,

You start the timer to "hideaway" from the distractions. This closes extra apps, turns on do not disturb, hides the dock, and lets you run any other scripts you'd like. Then, when the timer is done, it resets your Mac back to the state it was in before the hideaway session. I'm building it with Node (Electron) and React (Next.js).`,

It also lets you add padding and other "side effects" to see how the components work when placed in different situations.`,

It includes my favorite colors in my favorite flat/pastel style. Although I built it primarily for myself, I made it open source so anyone can use it if they also happen to like the style.`,
